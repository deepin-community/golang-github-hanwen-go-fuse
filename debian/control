Description: Native Go bindings for the FUSE kernel module
 This package offers native Go bindings for FUSE, and has several features:
 .
  * High speed: as fast as libfuse using the gc compiler for single
    threaded loads.
 .
  * Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
    subdirectories of the FUSE mount.
 .
  * Supports 3 interfaces for writing filesystems:
    - PathFileSystem: define filesystems in terms path names.
    - NodeFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of inodes.
    - RawFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of FUSE's raw
      wire protocol.
 .
  * Both NodeFileSystem and PathFileSystem support manipulation of true
    hardlinks.
 .
 The package also includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.
